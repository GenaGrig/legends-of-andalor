            <p>The Idea about the band was in the air for several years. When the founder, Gena, was in the band called
                “Fire Legion”, he started to create songs for his own project,
                called "GenStar Project". It was a collaboration between Gena, who wrote the music, and several other
                artists, such as text writer Olga and singer Yan.
                The plan was to make an EP release, but it was postponed due to certain circumstances. The creation of
                Legends of Andalor was discussed and planned in the end of May 2022
                by two former Fire Legion members, Gena and Natalia. After the last concert of Fire Legion, that band
                was dissolved, and the creation of this new symphonic metal band was almost decided.
                The first rehearsal of the new band was held on June 22 and it was a success. The band decided to make
                so-called “silent rehearsals” with in-ear monitoring and playbacks.
                The first idea was to pre-record playbacks of orchestra and guitars and to make only drums and vocals as
                live elements, but later it was decided to play live guitar,
                bass and vocals, leaving only playbacks and drums pre-recorded. The band’s future was on the line when,
                in the beginning of August, the singer decided not to continue
                with music in general. After discussions, a consensus was found and both founders decided to continue
                with the band and give it a try until New Year’s Eve and see what happens...
                After New Year’s Eve band is still alive and has a lot of plans in year 2023, so stay tuned!

            <h1>Short story of Legends.</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The band was completed with a bass player, Luna, in late August and from that time the band started to
                rehearse two times a week with songs written for the GenStar Project,
                some old Fire Legion songs which were re-made in symphonic metal style, as well as newly written
                material. In December 2022, the band was only four months old and it
                released its first single called "Follow your path", making its first concert in front of their fans
                (that concert was in November though) and getting a very positive feedback.
                We have a lot of plans in the future and we hope to get to on a bigger stage, making more nice symphonic
                metal music and releasing more songs and music videos.
                The Legend has just begun...
