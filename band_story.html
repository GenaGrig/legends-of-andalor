        <h1>Pre-story</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Idea of the band was in the air in several years. When the founder was in Fire Legion band, he started to create songs for his
            own project, called "GenStar Project". It was a collaboration of the founder who wrote the music and several other artists as a text writer
            Olga and the singer Yan. The plan was to make a release of EP, but it was postponed due to certain circumstances.
            The creation of the band was discussed and planned in the end of May 2022 by two former Fire Legion members Gena and Natalia.
            After the last concert of Fire Legion, band was dismissed, and the creation of new symphonic metal band was almost decided.
            First rehearsals of new band was held during June 22 and they were successful. Band decided to make silent rehearsals
            with in-ear monitoring and playbacks. First idea was to pre-record playbacks of orchestra and guitars and make only drums and vocals to play
            live, but later it was deciced to play live guitar, bass and vocals, leaving only playbacks and drums pre-recorded.
            The band future was on the line, when in the beginning of August, singer decided not to continue with music in general. After
            the discussions consensus was found and both founders decided to continue with a band and give it a try till the new years eve
            and see what happens...

        <h1>Short story of Legends.</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Band was completed with a bass player in late August and from that time band started to rehearse two times a week with a songs
            written to a GenStar Project, some old Fire Legion songs, re-made in symphonic metal style and new written material. In December 2022
            band was only four month long and by that time it released its first single called "Follow your path", making its first concert
            in front of their fans and getting a very positive feedback. There are a lot of plans in the future and the hope to get on a bigger stage,
            making more good symphonic metal music and releasing more songs and first music video. The Legend has just begun...
