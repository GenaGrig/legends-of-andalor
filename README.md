## Testing
### Functionality testing
* #### Navigation bar
  - Navigation bar was tested on a computer with big 27' screen, laptop, tablet and mobile phones. 
  - Navigation bar becomes a hamburger menu on screen sizes smaller than 1100px, because testing showed that it is the optimal size, when menu do not sticks outside the screen and has maximum width.
  - The hamburger menu stays on top on all pages and is easy to havigate, all links are working.
  - The only problem on a mobile phones is a dropdown menu. It is hard to click on a Members link, because it is quite close to Story and I have not figured how to make a space between this two links wider.

* #### Heading below navigation bar
   - This heading in different variations is presented on each website page and changes three times on a screen sizes below 1100px, 850px and 376px to not override the menu and disturb pressing the menu button.

* #### Main page
  - Five boxes itself are responsive and changes on different screen sizes in width and the center Gallery box falls down below others on screen size below 600px. 
  - The images inside are not responsive and stays on their places despite of box changes. I do not make them responsive and clickable, because it will make the whole project more complex and right now this is not neccessary.

* #### General testing
  - All pages were checked on a tablet and mobile phone for responsive design and successfull working of such elements as:
    - Navigation bar. Every link works and opens in a parent tab.
    - Social media links on the top of the page. Every link works and opens in a new tab.
    - All elements of every page are responsive and shows correctly on a tablet and mobile phones. Margins are correct and nothing extends the screen width or overrides other elements. 
    - Widgets on music page are sized and shows correctly on every screen size.
    - Shows page table and buttons are responsive and easy to read and understand. Button links working and opens in new tab.
