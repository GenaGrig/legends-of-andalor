## Testing
### Functionality testing
* #### Navigation bar
  - Navigation bar was tested on a computer with big 27' screen, laptop, tablet and mobile phones. 
  - Navigation bar becomes a hamburger menu on screen sizes smaller than 1100px, because testing showed that it is the optimal size, when menu do not sticks outside the screen and has maximum width.
  - The hamburger menu stays on top on all pages and is easy to havigate, all links are working.
  - The only problem on a mobile phones is a dropdown menu. It is hard to click on a Members link, because it is quite close to Story and I have not figured how to make a space between this two links wider.

* #### Heading below navigation bar
   - This heading in different variations is presented on each website page and changes three times on a screen sizes below 1100px, 850px and 376px to not override the menu and disturb pressing the menu button.

* #### Main page
  - Five boxes itself are responsive and changes on different screen sizes in width and the center Gallery box falls down below others on screen size below 600px. 
  - The images inside are not responsive and stays on their places despite of box changes. I do not make them responsive and clickable, because it will make the whole project more complex and right now this is not neccessary.

* #### General testing
  - All pages were checked on a tablet and mobile phone for responsive design and successfull working of such elements as:
    - Navigation bar. Every link works and opens in a parent tab.
    - Social media links on the top of the page. Every link works and opens in a new tab.
    - All elements of every page are responsive and shows correctly on a tablet and mobile phones. Margins are correct and nothing extends the screen width or overrides other elements. 
    - Widgets on music page are sized and shows correctly on every screen size.
    - Shows page table and buttons are responsive and easy to read and understand. Button links working and opens in new tab.
    - Band members page is showing correctly in a column style on screens below 800px and mobile phones.
    - Gallery photo rows are collapsing when screen changes size from wide to narrow.

## Usability testing
* To get some feedback I gave link of this site to my band members and requested a code review in a peer-code-review channel in Slack. 
- One feedback was given from Slack channel, saying 
> Hi it looks really good, I'm looking at this on a mobile, just look at the heading on band/members it's a bit too big and preventing me to click on the menu button again to select something else. Well done on completing first project     
- This error was fixed.
- Feedbacks from band members was positive and website was checked on both tablet and mobile phone. No negative issues were concerned and everything was tested and is working as it should on all devices.
